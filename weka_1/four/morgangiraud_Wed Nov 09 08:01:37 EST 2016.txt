This repo is the result of some work done in the Startup Weekend AI in Paris. It contains two models: DISCLAIMER This repo does not contains the trainings/dev/test sets due to proprietary concerns. Completely blowing up previous bees larvae detections i know of using OpenCV, and this was achieved thanks to only 2000 training samples which is a very small dataset. Also, it took less than 10 minutes to train it This validate again and gain the fact that deep learning is very well suited to handle real life data and its variability. The training phase is interesting in terms of overfitting: We can see that we reach 0% () error on the training set which means we completely overfit the data, yet the generalization on the dev set keeps improving until no learning is possible anymore. This is a clear indicator that more data would improve even more the accuracy, also we probably can simplify it even further and improve performance for this simple binary classifier. You can test both models by running script. And finally you can even export a frozen model using . if you want to use it in production with TensorFlow in a more convenient way.
