Fixes #2 Oct 23, 2016 LICENSE Initial commit Oct 22, 2016 README.md Added summary of the paper Nov 1, 2016 README.md CNN-Sentence-Classifier Simplified implementation of "Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification" paper Usage Install Keras Repository contains "Movie reviews with one sentence per review" (Pang and Lee, 2005) dataset in sample_dataset. Alternatively, to use some other dataset, make two files input.txt where each line is a sentence to be classified label.txt where each line is the label for corresponding line in input.txt Make model folder by running mkdir model Refer this to train or download Glove embeddings and this for Word2Vec embeddings. Run python3 app/train.py --data_dir=path_to_folder_containing_input.txt_and_label.txt --embedding_file_path=path_to_embedding_vectors_file --model_name=name_of_model_from_the_paper For example, if data is in data folder, embedding file is vectors.txt and model is cnn_static, run python3 app/train.py --data_dir=data --embedding_file_path=vectors.txt --model_name=cnn_static To define your own model, pass model_name as self, define your model in app/model/model.py and invoke from model_selector function (in model.py).
