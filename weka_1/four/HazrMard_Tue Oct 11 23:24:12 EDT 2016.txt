Machine Learning on imgur. Under development. Basic interface is complete. is a set of tools that help parse, analyze, and act on textual data on imgur.com. It provides a modular interface that lets you build trivial to complex workflows. From making a random comment bot, to systemically detecting and downvoting memes and posts about cats: you can do it all. The latter was my primary motivation for this project, but that's another story. While initially written for imgur, the project has been structured so that it can be easily ported to another API. Additionally, many machine learning functions in can be universally used with any data set out of the box. provides an option to use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) as a way to reduce the dimensionality of data points. For a given set of data, it finds vectors that best describe the set's distribution. Those vectors can be used as axes for later computations. For example, posts on imgur.com may have thousands of unique words which would mean thousands of dimensions in the data. But with PCA, a few vectors can be used to distinguish posts without significant loss in accuracy. With fewer vectors needed to describe posts and users (by their comments), other computations become less costly. For example, you can try to predict: All of the machine learning methods above in parentheses have been implemented in the class, with more to come. also provides the class. It can post comments, upload pictures, send messages etc. interactively or in the backround on whatever schedule you choose. See docs folder for more details on usage. This was my first ever project on github. I had left it in suspension in favour of other things to do. I came back more than a year later to finish this. If you compare last year's version v1 with this one () you'll notice quite a change in approach. That's the lesson here folks,
