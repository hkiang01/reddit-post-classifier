This is a proof of concept demo I built showing the potential for cracking mobile device pin codes / inferring touch locations via a compromised website that logs gyroscope and accelerometer data streams.

Basic logic flow is:

1) Independent (no dependencies and fits W3C specification so it is supported in every mobile browser) JS script logs both accelerometer and gyroscope sensor streams on a compromised website to a Mongo database.

2) Matlab pulls in sensor streams from Mongo and processes them before passing the processed sequences to a trained artificial neural network.

The network was trained on a sample of 1514 manually collected key presses. The artificial neural network is extremely simple, consisting of one hidden layer with 1000 nodes. Training was done using gradient descent with a learning rate of 0.01. The network is trained using cross entropy loss to output class (0-9) probabilities  for each key press. This setup assumes the ability to distinguish taps. 

All questions are welcome :)
