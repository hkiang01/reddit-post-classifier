This is my Keras implementation of the paper with the same name (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.02049v1.pdf) The dataset was obtained from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/UJIIndoorLoc Huge shoutout to Aqib Saeed (https://github.com/aqibsaeed/) for their initial TensorFlow implementation (https://github.com/aqibsaeed/Place-Recognition-using-Autoencoders-and-NN)!
