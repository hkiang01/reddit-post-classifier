Hey guys, just thought some of you might enjoy this.


I've set up an community AMI on aws that I've done a simul-build of a lot of the bleeding-edge releases of some of the most popular machine learning/deep learning packages/modules around.


Some hilights: 

p2.xlarge 

NVIDIA Tesla K80 

Ubuntu 14.04 

CUDA 8.0 

cuDNN 5.1 

OpenCV 3.1 

Spark 2.0 

Caffe 1.0 

Tensorflow 

Theano 

Keras 

Torch 7 

Microsoft CNTK V2 

R 

Scala 

Julia


I went through a lot of headaches getting this set up, so hopefully this can help newcomers in the field of ML/DL get their feet wet with some code in different systems/languages without any of the hassle of dependency version conflicts and source build seg faults :D


Enjoy!
