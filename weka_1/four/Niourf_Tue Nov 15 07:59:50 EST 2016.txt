Surprise is an easy-to-use open source Python library for recommender systems. Its goal is to make life easier for reseachers who want to play around with new algorithms ideas, for teachers who want some teaching materials, and for students. Surprise was designed with the following purposes in mind: The name SurPRISE (roughly) stands for Simple Python RecommendatIon System Engine. The easiest way is to use pip (you'll need numpy): Or you can clone the repo and build the source (you'll need Cython and numpy): Here is a simple example showing how you can (down)load a dataset, split it for 3-folds cross-validation, and compute the MAE and RMSE of the SVD algorithm. surprise surprise Dataset surprise evaluate # Load the movielens-100k dataset (download it if needed), # and split it into 3 folds for cross-validation. data Dataset.load_builtin() data.split() # We'll use the famous SVD algorithm. algo SVD() # Evaluate performances of our algorithm on the dataset. perf evaluate(algo, data, [, ]) (perf) The following table shows the average RMSE and MAE and total execution time of various algorithms on a 5-folds cross-validation procedure. The dataset is the Movielens 100k dataset. All experiments are run on a laptop with Intel Core i3 1.7 GHz, 4Go Ram. The documentation with many other usage examples is available online on ReadTheDocs. This project is licensed under the GPLv3 license.
