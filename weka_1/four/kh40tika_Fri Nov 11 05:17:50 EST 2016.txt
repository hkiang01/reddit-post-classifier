This is a naive implementation of DeepMind's Differentiable Neural Computer model. Clone this repository first. Then run script in interactive mode. NOTE: If you don't run in interactive mode it will just quit silently. Compilation in theano is a bit slow so it may take a while. Once compiled, you can just call python functions defined in . The default training task is the conditional copy task, the network must produce input signal in same or reversed order, depending on the first "condition" signal. You may want to modify the code to introduce new tasks. Most useful functionalities are shown below:
