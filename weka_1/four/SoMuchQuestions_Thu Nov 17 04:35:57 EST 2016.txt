For a work related project, I need to use a recursive neural network (not recurrent). This architecture is well described at page 400 of: 

&gt; Goodfellow, Ian, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville. Deep Learning. MIT Press, 2016. Chapter 10, [http://www.deeplearningbook.org/contents/rnn.html](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/contents/rnn.html).

The architecture is shown in the following screenshot taken from this very same book:

In my case : I want the tree structure to be dependent of the data (each individual of the training set has its own tree structure) and the length of the sequence not constant.

Any ideas on how i should proceed ? My best guess right now would be to implement the whole thing myself using Theano. The project found [here](https://github.com/ofirnachum/tree_rnn) is a great start

For the record, I also posted an [issue ](https://github.com/fchollet/keras/issues/4395) on keras github.
