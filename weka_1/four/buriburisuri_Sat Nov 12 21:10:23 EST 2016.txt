A tensorflow implementation of French-to-English machine translation using DeepMind's ByteNet from the paper Nal et al's Neural Machine Translation in Linear Time. This paper proposed the fancy method which replaced the traditional RNNs with conv1d dilated and causal conv1d, and they achieved fast training and state-of-the-art performance on character-level translation. The architecture ( from the paper ) I've used NLTK's comtrans English-French parallel corpus for convenience. You can easily download it as follows: to train the network. You can see the result ckpt files and log files in the 'asset/train' directory. Launch tensorboard --logdir asset/train/log to monitor training process. I've trained this model on a single Titan X GPU during 10 hours until 50 epochs. If you don't have a Titan X GPU, reduce batch_size in the train.py file from 16 to 8. to translate sample French sentences to English. The result will be printed on the console. The result looks messy but promising. Though Comtrans corpus in NLTK is very small(in my experiment only 17,163 pairs used), the model have learned English words structures and syntax by character level. I think that the translation accuracy will be better if we use big corpus. You can translate French sentences to English sentences with the pre-trained model on the Comtrans corpus in NLTK. Extract the following zip file in 'asset/train/ckpt'. And try another sample French sentences in the 'translate.py' file. Namju Kim (buriburisuri@gmail.com) at Jamonglabs Co., Ltd.
