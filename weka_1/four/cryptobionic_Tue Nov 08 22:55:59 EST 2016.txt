The current model was trained on screenshots taken from Pokemon Silver, Crystal, and Diamond, then tested on Pokemon Blue Version. Sample results below. -c --checkpoint_dir <str> [path to save the model] You can use this with some sample training images provided in . Run to start training on the small amount of sample images. This will create a directory called in the folder. If you get an error about CUDA running out of memory, reduce the batch size. The files in the folder are as follows: The training attempts to obtain the resized color image when given the resized gray image. I've included a trained model in the directory that you can run your own images on. You can either run the model on one image or a folder of images. For one image, run and pass it the model and the image as parameters. To run it on multiple images, run and pass it the model and the folder to the images. will save your images in the folder, where as will save them in the current directory. Examples: There are scripts included to help create your own dataset, which is desirable because the amount of data needed to obtain good results is a good amount. The results below were trained on about 50,000 images. The easiest method to obtain images is to extract them from Youtube walkthrough videos of different games. Given that you have a folder with videos use to extract images from each video. Just pass it the folder containing images. Depending on if the video had a border around the game, you may need to use to crop out the border. There are comments in the script you can uncomment to view the image before it crops all of them to be sure the cropping is correct. Finally, use to create resized and gray images for training.
