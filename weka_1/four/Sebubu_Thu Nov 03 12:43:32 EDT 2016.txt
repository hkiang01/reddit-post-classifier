I have done a transfer learning project to distinguish between different mushroom species. The showcase can be accessed via **[mushreco.ml](http://mushreco.ml/en/)**.

Technical details:

* The classifier has been trained on 208 categories of mushrooms. Every category contains between 60 and 100 training images which is definitely at the lower end. 
* All images have been scrapped via Google, Yahoo and Baidu. The images where filtered by myself to avoid too many wrong mushrooms in a category.
* At the end, I had 18'000 images in the dataset. 
* A pretrained Resnet50 on imagenet has been used as a general image descriptor. 
* The whole work was done with Keras. Keras provides quite cool and easy to use pretrained models!

My first impression of the task was that it will never work. The diversity in only one species is enormous. A mushroom can look completely different if it is young vs. old. Also the amount of available data is critical. But hey, I gave it a try ;)


At the end, the classifier works impressively exact. It will not replace a expert but can help you identifying a mushroom.
