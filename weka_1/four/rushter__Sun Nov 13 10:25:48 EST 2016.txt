A collection of minimal and clean implementations of machine learning algorithms. This project is targeting people who want to learn internals of ml algorithms or implement them from scratch. The code is much easier to follow than the optimized libraries and easier to play with. All algorithms are implemented in Python, using numpy, scipy and autograd. Your contributions are always welcome!
