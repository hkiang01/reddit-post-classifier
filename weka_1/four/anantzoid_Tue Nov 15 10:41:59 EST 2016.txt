Altify automizes the task of inserting alternative text attributes for image tags. Altify uses Microsoft Computer Vision API's deep learning algorithms to caption images in an HTML file and returns a new HTML file in which alt attributes are filled out with their corresponding captions. Notice: Altify will now ignore any image tag whose alt attribute has content or is just an empty string. (In compliance with standard web practices) A new HTML file called altify.html is created next to the HTML file you selected.
