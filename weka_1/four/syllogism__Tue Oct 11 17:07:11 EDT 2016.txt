The State of AI Take the survey About the survey Machine learning is changing the world by greatly extending the range of problems that software can solve. The web is full of predictions about where we might be headed, but where are we now? What’s already here and what’s coming soon? Who’s building these systems and how? The results will be 100% open-source for everyone to access and analyze. Who’s behind this? This survey was produced by Ines Montani and Matthew Honnibal of Explosion AI and Nathan Benaich of Playfair Capital. Our goal is to coordinate a crowdsourced effort to help the community figure out how successful systems are being built, and what challenges teams are facing. If you’re working on AI technologies, we hope you’ll take a few minutes to share your experiences. Get the results! Drop us your email address and we’ll notify you when the data is ready!
