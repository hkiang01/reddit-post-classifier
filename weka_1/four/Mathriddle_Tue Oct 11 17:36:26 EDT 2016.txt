Each month we will hold one Kaggle focused meetup. The group will vote on the competition topic and break up into teams. Each team will consist of a Team Leader, Algorithm experts, Programmers, and Data mungers(this can change depending on the category). We will try to rank as high as possible on the leader-boards. Once the competition is complete, we will hold a debriefing for all participating teams to discuss best practices, suggestions for future competitions and an analysis of our performance. If we win a competition, then the proceeds will be distributed equally amongst each member of the winning team.
