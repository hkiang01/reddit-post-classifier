I've decided to try and learn as much as I can on the topic. I want to read the relevant background papers and associated blog posts and source code.

Could anyone point me in the right direction, i.e. papers to read and links?

Here's what I have so far:

* DRCN - [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.04491)
* Sub-Pixel Convolutional Neural Network - [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.05158)
* Perceptual Losses - [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08155)
* GAN SISR - [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04802)

Note that I got this list from alexjc's [neural-enhance](https://github.com/alexjc/neural-enhance) README. I guess I'd also need to read the first [GAN paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661).

Thanks in advance for the help!
