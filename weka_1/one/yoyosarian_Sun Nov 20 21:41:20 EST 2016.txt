I have been playing around with compressing atari games on to small 2048 lstms [here](https://github.com/loliverhennigh/Compressing-Dynamical-Systems-Atari). This is by no means an original idea and has been tried [here](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/reports2016/116_Report.pdf). I am just wondering if this is a promising idea. It seems in the paper listed they were unable to get very good results.
