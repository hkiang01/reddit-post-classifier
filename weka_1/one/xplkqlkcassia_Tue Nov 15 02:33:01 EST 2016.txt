As a chronic time-waster and someone who likes to play around with Google Translate, I found that the Translate team seems to have rolled out other NMT-based language pairs (I haven't heard news about it anywhere). These all appear work both ways - instead of SMT where phrase-blocks are highlighted, the entire sentence is highlighted:

* English -&gt; French
* English -&gt; German
* English -&gt; Spanish
* English -&gt; Chinese
* English -&gt; Portuguese
* English -&gt; Japanese
* English -&gt; Korean

Some things to note: 

* It can fuse together words in German. German grammar allows you to fuse nouns together into a single word. SMT can't do this, NMT does it spectacularly, forming words that have never been formed before. It even does this with words that are very rare, or words that I made up, which is pretty impressive.

 * **The pancake dog is ready!** -&gt; *Der Pfannkuchenhund ist fertig!*
 * **The jam holder mechanism is durable.** -&gt; *Der Stauhaltermechanismus ist langlebig.*
 * **The dark grey road cleaning machine is in the wax cupboard.** -&gt; *Die dunkelgraue Stra√üenreinigungsmaschine befindet sich im Wachsschrank.*

* It can make reasonable guesses as to the gender of a non-word in languages which use genders (French, Spanish, German, Portuguese), and will always capitalise it appropriately in German. For example, I made up the word "an olutura", which translated as "una olutura", whereas "a pakank" translated as "un pakank".

 * **When I was walking in the park yesterday, I saw an olutura and a pakank lying on the ground.** -&gt; *Cuando estaba caminando en el parque ayer, vi una olutura y un pakank tendido en el suelo.*

I've [linked](https://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/comments/5d17vy/google_translate_recently_implemented_new_neural/) an example of this to /r/linguistics, and I'm hoping they'll do some destructive testing to more fully figure out whether the new algorithm is able to capture the quirks of those particular languages.
