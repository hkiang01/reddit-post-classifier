I was wondering what advice you could give about training CNNs for image segmentation or classification. What I would like to know is:

1. How to do hyperparameter tuning? Suppose we have 3000 images for training, on GPU some networks take 12 or more hours to train. I would like to change some parameters but not wait that long each time. Is it relevant to train on a smaller subset? (How small, keep the batch size?)

2. How to choose the batch size? Is it ok to have very small batch size like 2?

3. How to choose the learning rate? Does it depend on image size or on the batch size?

4. How to handle very large images? For example size of 1024 x 2048? I'm concerned that the GPU does not have enough memory for such large images when using very deep architectures.

5. I think that plotting the loss and accuracy would be good. The loss should be going down and the accuracy up. Should I look to something else when analyzing these plots? Should I analyze other parameters?

6. Is it necessary to check the gradients? 

7. When to use learning rate decay?

Any advice on what steps to follow when training and how to do hyperparameter tuning would be appreciated.
