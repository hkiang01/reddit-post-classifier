Suppose I've got a dataset with repeated measures within research subjects. I want to use a random intercept rather than fixed effects for the intercept term specific to the research subject. If I'd used fixed effects I'd have one parameter per research subject, but using random effects I'd have only two parameters total (the mean and SD of the normal distribution for the random effects). However, in the end, with random effects I still get one intercept estimate per subject along with standard errors for these intercept terms. Granted these have been shrunken toward the global mean, but shouldn't I still essentially have one parameter per subject?
