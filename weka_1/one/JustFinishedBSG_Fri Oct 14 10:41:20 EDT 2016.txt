Hello,

I'm interested in knowing how stochastic calculus could be used in machine learning. I have no idea where to start looking. It would seem to me that exploiting time continuity in some problems could bring a lot of very very powerful tools.

If anybody has pointers to the right direction.

Thanks

( i have tried to googling my question, only find unrelated articles about quants. Some links on variational inference too, would that be a direction ?)
