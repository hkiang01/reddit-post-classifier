Suppose you have image metadata you want to incorporate into a classifier, want to train an RNN over categorical data, or simply want a reference result for a problem where you expect SVM or RF to do best.  

How do you preprocess the data and what transforms and architectures are known to work well?

If you're incorporating high information features with image/audio data where you need the network to learn to extract features, how would you structure the model?
