In decision tree classifier most of the algorithms use Information gain as spiting criterion. We select the feature with maximum information gain to split on.

I think that using accuracy instead of information gain is simpler approach. Is there any scenario where accuracy doesn't work and information gain does?

Can anyone explain what are the advantages of using Information gain over accuracy as splitting criterion?
