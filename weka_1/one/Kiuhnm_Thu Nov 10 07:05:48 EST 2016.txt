I asked this question both on Stack Overflow and on Theano's newsgroup (Yes, I'm using Theano), but I got no answer, which makes me think that what I'm trying to do is quite unusual.

Basically, I need to solve a linear system as part of the computation of a neural network. Ideally I'd like to solve a linear system, but inverting the matrix shouldn't be a problem since it's small (100x100) and well conditioned.

The problem with Theano is that it needs [Cula](http://www.culatools.com/downloads/dense/) to work on Gpu, but, as you can see, the website has some problems.

Can you think of a workaround? I googled quite a bit but it seems that my needs are unusual. Is there any other library/framework that will do what I need (on GPU)?

I'm also OK with doing the inversion/solve on CPU and the rest of the computations on GPU, but I don't think one can mix CPU and GPU code in Theano and I think that breaking the computation into many functions would interfere with automatic differentiation.

Update: This [PR](https://github.com/Theano/Theano/pull/4917) solves the problem!
