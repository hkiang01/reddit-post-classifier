I am a 3rd year CS student trying to make an application that will auto-group faces of the same person like google photos does.
I used OpenFace, an open source implementation of Google's FaceNet paper, which uses triplet loss to generate a [1 x 127] representation of an person's face. 
Now that I have a representation for each photo in my data-set, I would like to cluster photos of the same person together. The tricky part here is that I do not know exactly how many unique people are in the dataset.

Could anyone provide any guidance to cluster photos of the same person without knowing the number of clusters?. 

Thank you for your time.
