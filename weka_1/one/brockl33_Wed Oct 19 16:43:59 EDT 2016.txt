This was discovered through manual facial recognition between youtube videos.

Could deep learning be used to detect faces that regularly appear in videos of protests to identify "regulars" a.k.a. paid agents that move around the country organizing fake protests?

I want to ask whether deep learning could help sift through the WikiLeaks emails for collusion, but that task seems far away.
