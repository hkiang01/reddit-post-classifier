There's quite a lot of recent work in energy-based generative models (for example, energy-based [directed generative models](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03439), [energy-based GANs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.03126), etc.) as well as a lot of work out of Yoshua Bengio's group on links between energy-based models and biology (e.g. [e-prop](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.03126)). What are some interesting open research questions in this field?
