By data-to-text I mean a black box which takes numbers and spits out natural language. This is a spacial case of NLG.

There are papers floating around on this subject, but they do not publish their code (**how is this still a thing?**)

EDIT:

Not really.

[SimpleNLG](https://github.com/simplenlg/simplenlg) is an example if what I'm looking for, but it's not an incomplete implementation of an old NLG method.

This paper explains data-to-text: http://homepages.abdn.ac.uk/e.reiter/pages/papers/enlg07.pdf
