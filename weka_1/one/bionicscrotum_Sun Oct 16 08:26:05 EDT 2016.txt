Hey everyone,

I'm currently doing a Master's focusing on ML and deep learning in particular. The more I got into DL, the more I realized that neither my laptop, nor the (CPU-only) compute cluster from my university are enough to train any nontrivial models.

Because of this, I've decided to build my own (student-budget, but still as beefy as possible) rig. I plan on using it to quickly iterate on models in may areas, ranging from NLP to medical image processing (e.g. 3D CNNs over MRI data). This would be my first PC build. I plan on using it for gaming less than 5% of the time.

After doing a fair bit of research, I learned that the best card I could get at the moment would (obviously) be the Pascal Titan X, but that the 1080 has a much better price-quality ratio. This ratio is even better for the 1070, but I believe that the increased memory bandwidth of the 1080 makes it worth my money.

I aimed for a beefy but not over-the-top CPU, and a fast but small SSD to keep my OS and 1-2 small datasets on which I would be working. I don't plan on working with huge datasets (&gt;100-200Gb ) in the foreseeable future. I got 32 gigs of ram in a 2x16 kit, so that I can upgrade to 64 if necessary (this is likely not a bottleneck given the 8Gb video memory).

I would be *very* grateful for some feedback/hints on my current specs. For example:

  1. Is the CPU too much? Would a plain-old i5 also work?
  2. Should I aim for a different GPU manufacturer (e.g. MSI), or is Zotac fine?
  3. Is there anything (apart from monitor, keyboard, and mouse) that it missing?
  4. Any blatant incompatibilities/weird stuff?

Thank you very much in advance! Here's the build:
