Hey everyone,

I have a question. Are there relatively simple tasks which cannot be done by conventional neural networks? I mean some kind of conscious problems (which can be done by human, but not solvable by machine learning).

For example, text-based question answering, when the text doesn't directly contain an answer. Like this:  
- *Input*: grass is green.  
- *Input*: grass is plant.  
- *Input*: what is grass color?  
- *Output*: green.  
Of course, the neural network is previously trained to understand and distinguish colors. But the word "grass" is mentioned for the first time.

Sorry, if I made a dumb example, but maybe you could explain how it can be done?  
What simple tasks unsolvable by machine learning can you come up with?
