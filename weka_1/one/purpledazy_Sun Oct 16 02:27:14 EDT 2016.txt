I am having a problem formalising my data questions as probabilistic programming/graphical models, for some reason the gap between examples provided in various books and real-life scenarios seems too far to bridge. 

For example -
In one case my goal is to predict the number of months left for a building construction to be completed.
The data I have available is a list of buildings in a region with those features:

* When did the construction of each building started

* The number of workers that worked/still working on its construction - per month since the construction started

* Number of floors the building has/planned to have

* Has the construction finished or not? (in the form of finish date or null)


My ‘progress’ so far:

* I think the model’s output of interest would be a distribution of ‘time it takes to complete a building' dependent on the number of floors, number of workers per month, and how many months have passed since the construction started.

* The prior for that would be the current distribution months it took to complete the existing completed buildings (so filtering out all non-completed buildings from the dataset)

* The number of floors parameter seems like it should be modelled as a hierarchical component (either each number of floors or a subgroup will have a different distribution of ‘number of workers per month’) - that’s based on a hunch that buildings with more floors require more workers but in a non-linear way.

Two things that I feel I am stuck with are: 

* How to model the ‘number of workers’ data since it requires two parameters - time (e.g., month index since construction started) and the number of workers at that period… the distributions in the examples I’ve seen model a single ‘value’. I can break this into a fixed array of multiple distributions (one per month) but for some reason that doesn’t seem right… (how will all those distributions be tied to each other? see next point)

* How to tie the number of floors and distribution of workers to target distribution?

Many thanks for reading all this, really not sure how to get help to go beyond the text book examples in probabilistic programming/graph models… quite frustrating, since I am really keen on applying it in my work.
