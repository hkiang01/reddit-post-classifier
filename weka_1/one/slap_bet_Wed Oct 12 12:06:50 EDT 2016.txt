I'm currently writing a couple of papers which use CNNs and one thing I really struggle with is making nice looking diagrams that are actually clear. I've seen figures in other papers (for example, picturing convolutional layers as cubes, stuff like that) that seem to be very clear but I haven't really figured out 1) what they're using to make those and 2) there is not really an agreed upon style for enumerating and illustrating network design. Does anyone have any light to shed here, is there a drawing tool (LaTeX compatible) that is good for this kind of thing or is it just lots and lots of tikz?
