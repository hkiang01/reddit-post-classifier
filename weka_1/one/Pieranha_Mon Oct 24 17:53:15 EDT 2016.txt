I need to model the dynamics of time-evolving bipartite graphs, where one side, U, has nodes m=100 and the other side, V, has nodes n=5. There's roughly 50 time steps. The goal is to categorize millions of such graphs into one of 10 well-known labels, which are supplied with the graphs.

Nodes in U have the same meaning across graphs, whereas this is not the case for nodes in V (i.e. nodes in U are ordered, whereas nodes in V are unordered). The graphs are unweighted, start with a single link and 1-3 links are added with every time step. Links cannot be removed. Each graph has the same # of nodes, but different # of timesteps. Most importantly, the link creation dynamics are wildly different. Capturing these dynamics are critical to do the labeling properly.

What are some ways this could be modeled? I'm in the brainstorming phase so all ideas are highly appreciated!
