Lets say I have a decent budget(500k) to spend on solving a problem that can most likely only benefit from optimization techniques used in Machine Learning.
What options are available to me?  
  
It seams like money goes to the cool or relevant enough proposals, not ones directed at solving a very specific problem. Is this "seller's market" interpretation accurate? Industry takes what it can get?   
  
Are the most qualified people to handle this doing so in a research capacity?  
What reliable consultancies exist? Can you list a few?
