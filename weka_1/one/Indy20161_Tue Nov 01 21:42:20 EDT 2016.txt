I dropped out from CS school(3rd year) because I didn't like studying there and then I studied 2 years of finance(associate's degree) and then I decided to give machine learning Nanodegree from udacity a shot, I completed it and loved it. Now I 'm very sure that I want to do ML. What should I do next to make a good career in ML?

And I'm reading Kevin murphy's book and absolutely love it.
