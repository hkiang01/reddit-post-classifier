Hi, I tried to implement a neural network and failed. I faced 2 problems:  
1. I needed a multi-dimensional dynamic array. Using normal arrays failed, so I used Eigen.  
2. I couldn't model the NN well. It seems too complex.   
The problem with 2 is it may be hard to imagine the whole possible structures in my mind. How to architect big programs?  
I asked a professor and the reply was to use a NN library, but I found 2 problems:  
1. License: Will I be arrested if I used a library like CNTK in a comercial product?  
*Note: I used CNTK as an example, because I prefer C++ over Python.*  
2. What if it wasn't enough and I've to implement something by myself?  
  
What are your advices? Should I try again or use a library? I'm planning to make something like the neuron simulator **NEST**.
