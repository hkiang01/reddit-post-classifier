In "Improved Techniques for Training GANs", I am surprised by performance of semi-supervised learning presented in paper.

But I am not sure how semi-supervised learning perform better than others such as Auxiliary Deep Generative Model(ADGM) or Ladder network. 

As I understand, unlabeled data is discriminated from negative class (class# = K+1), and does not learn which class it could be. 
However, ADGM seems trying to infer class of unlabeled data. 

I really appreciate any comments/insight how it performs well.ï»¿
