Apologies in advance if this is the wrong place for this sort of post. If you guys are like me, you shift through hundreds of PDFs and haven't found a satisfactory research tool. I've been looking for quite some time and have not found one with the following set of features.

 * ability to search by author or title and edit the meta data( you usually have to correct this ).
 * ability to add multiple tags and search by tags
 * web, mobile or cross platform (I prefer tablet)
 * ability to annotate and share annotations with others
 * collaboration, ability to share work spaces, PDFs, notes exc.. exc..
 * drop box integration

Is there something out there that has the following set of features? The closest tool I found is LiquidText PDF for the iPad however it's missing a quite a few features from the above set.
