Hello all.

I want to be able to classify a time series of the response of a system when it is turned on and until it reaches some steady state.

Now I have time series of different types of systems (let's say of different quality of the systems).
I want to be able to predict the quality of the system based on the time series.

I know I could use some feature engineering, but I would much rather not have to. 
The other catches are
1)time series are not necessarily of the same length between quality classes and even in the same class
2)i cannot standardize the time series to make them zero mean unit variance
3)I have less than 500 time series for 2 classes
