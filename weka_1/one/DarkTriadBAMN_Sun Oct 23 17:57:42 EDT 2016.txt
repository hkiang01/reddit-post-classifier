Hey there

I'm trying to decide my schedule for the next semester and my main goal is to develop a toolset for self studying machine learning techniques over the summer. 


I've already checked that these 6 classes fit into one, non-overlapping schedule and that I have all pre-reqs. I would prefer to take 4 of the 6 classes but 5 might be possible (without being too overwhelmed).

here are my options:

----------------------------

Applied Differential Equations II
-----
Description of class:

Wave, heat and Laplace equations. Solutions by separation of variables and expansion in Fourier Series or other appropriate orthogonal sets. Sturm-Liouville problems. Introduction to methods for solving some classical partial differential equations.Use of power series as a tool in solving ordinary differential equations.

------------------


Mathematics of Scientific Computing
-----
Description of class:

This course will provide an overview of methods to solve quantitative problems and analyze data. The tools to be introduced are mathematical in nature and have links to Algebra, Analysis, Geometry, Graph Theory, Probability and Topology. Students will acquire an appreciation of (I) the fundamental role played by mathematics in countless applications and (II) the exciting challenges in mathematical research that lie ahead in the analysis of large data and uncertainties. Students will work on a project for each unit. While this is not a programming class, the students will do some programming through their projects.

Introduction to Modern Algebra for Mathematics Majors	
-----
Description of class:

Elementary number theory, equivalence relations, groups, homomorphisms, cosets, Cayley's Theorem, symmetric groups, rings, polynomial rings, quotient fields, principal ideal domains, Euclidean domains. 

------------

Introduction to Combinatorics
-----
Description of class:

Basic principles of counting: addition and multiplication principles, generating functions, recursive methods, inclusion-exclusion, pigeonhole principle; basic concepts of graph theory: graphs, digraphs, connectedness, trees; additional topics from:Polya theory of counting, Ramsey theory; combinatorial optimization - matching and covering, minimum spanning trees, minimum distance, maximum flow; sieves; mobius inversion; partitions; Gaussian numbers and q-analogues; bijections and involutions; partially ordered sets. 

------------------------

Mathematical Analysis I	
-----
Description of class:

Real number system, functions and limits, topology on the real line, continuity, differential and integral calculus for functions of one variable. Infinite series, uniform convergence. 

-----------------


Introduction to Mathematical Statistics II	
-----
Description of class:

Second of a two-semester sequence of mathematical statistics, primarily for undergraduate majors and graduate minors in Statistics. Random samples, point and interval estimators and their properties, methods of moments, maximum likelihood, tests ofhypotheses, elements of nonparametric statistics and elements of general linear model theory.
