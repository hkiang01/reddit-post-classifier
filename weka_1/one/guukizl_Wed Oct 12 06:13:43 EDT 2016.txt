This is mostly related to academia I guess. 

I am just gonna get it out and humiliate myself. 

I just wanted to ask if such a thing happens where in Math undergraduates (senior) are doing internships in ML. Consider my example, like I have taken courses in Statistics (two in number covering theoretical statistics ('statistical inference' by casella and berger)), linear algebra, calc apart from other pure math courses(eg.analysis) and have had experience with specifically use of Neural networks in ML in my last summer (you can pretty much sum that up by [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://www.neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com) and recently I had experience in appying RNNs (used LSTMs anyway) for time series data (a semester project). 


So is it, that it is too soon (like I haven't had formal intro to Statistical Learning or Optimization yet) for me to get into any "math" intensive i don't know research/project in ML and only masters and phd people do this kind of stuff or are math people (undergrads) getting into ML which is not just all about application?


I guess by a math undergraduate I also mean that he/she is not your classic programmer/cs major. As in he/she is able to implement anything in say python (or R) but he/she just would be much more interested in the mathematical intricacies of the models itself rather than cool implementations and usage of these algorithms on real data and analysing them. 

Thank you.
