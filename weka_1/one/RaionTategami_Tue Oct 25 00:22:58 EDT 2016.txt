EDIT: *I AM NOT GOING TO DO THIS!*
Thanks for the feedback everyone, the votes are in and it's a unanimous NO. I'm glad I asked, I personally would have found thing interesting but I'm clearly in the minority.

----------------------------

This is partly to get the mod's feedback since I can imagine just doing this randomly could get me in to trouble. This could be pretty cool but also annoying as hell if done incorrectly. Please take a look at the questions I want to discuss below.

So this is not an original idea and I have to imagine someone has possible already done this and not told anyone. You take this:
[A Neural Conversational Model](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.05869.pdf)
and throw it at this:
[i_have_every_publicly_available_reddit_comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/comments/3bxlg7/i_have_every_publicly_available_reddit_comment/) and let to loose on Reddit!

I have an initial implementation up and running and hope to improve it using some recent techniques. E.g. I think [HYPERNETWORKS](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.09106v1.pdf) are the current state of the art in language modelling.

Perhaps I should have seen this coming but...

**The main problem is that version 1 is a hateful, bigoted, sexist, condescending, potty-mouthed, meme spewing monster!**

Here are some *choice* outputs from my most recently trained model (these are in the form ACTUAL_REDDIT_COMMENT -&gt; RNN_GENERATED_REPLY)

*Responses of the RNN do not necessarily reflect the opinions of the author*

    "Well, that's just, like, your opinion man. --&gt; Fap fap fap fap fap fap fap fap fap fap fap fap." 
    RU/18 --&gt; I am trolling the most of the baby.
    It got gonorrhea. --&gt; gay as a ball of shit.
    things will turd around eventually --&gt; I never get reddit, I was there a lot.
    Step 2: moisture incurs. --&gt; You should think about your penis.
    What a jerk. Those people deserved to live. --&gt; It's what plants crave.
    Her brother is obviously agent 47. --&gt; You gotta go full retard.
    REDDIT IS NOT 4CHAN. --&gt; WE'LL DO IT LIVE!
    That's less people than voted for American Idol. --&gt; A panda inside of the motherfucker.
    --&gt; You say that like it's spelled *explainer*.
    *throws tomato* --&gt; **NOOOOOO!!!!**

I think my next step is to learn some subreddit embeddings as features so it can maybe learn that we don't swear in /r/MachineLearning as much?! 

So questions:

* Should the bot generally make it obvious that it is a bot? I initially wanted to just release it anonymously and see if it could get some positive karma. Kinda a Reddit-truing test.
* When and how often should it respond to things? My plan was to have it randomly pick a comment very rarely (~every 2 hours?). Respond to comments that respond to it and have a way to cause it to respond by having it's username in your comment for example.
* Is this even a good idea of should I just release it on /r/circlejerk, looks like it'd fit right in :)

Thoughts?

----------------------------
Some more examples just for fun:

    Happy Birthday! --&gt; a penis comment.  It's a palind of the round.
    Mohammad, Buddha and Ganesha all concur. --&gt; A trap
    *fap fap fap* --&gt; **crickets**.
    Ah yes, transparent aluminum. --&gt; I was your penis that I will not be a super funny.
    I didn't know vaginas could do the dishes. --&gt; asked for the greatest girl.
    HE'S A *NAGGER!* --&gt; ... was it an asshole?
    I am a peacock and I can confirm this. --&gt; I fucking listen to the leader of all.
    Is that the ship in BF BC2?? --&gt; hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
    i'm naked right now --&gt; interesting.
    Great. Now I have to masterbate. --&gt; if you're a robot dick there.
    where's dad?      son? --&gt; **SPOILER ALERT!**
    My gaydar was dinging when I saw that priest. --&gt; ... they do ass.
    Why did you leave the little piano? --&gt; in the best part of the sexual porn.
    Nikon always --&gt; How do you know what else was "Gray and single?"
    Figurative big, brass balls! --&gt; Dental Plan!
    Oh yeah. Sure. --&gt; Oh god that was going to be a meme.
    Nickelback. --&gt; Nice try, mathematic teacher.
    Can you cite a source for that? --&gt; Why do you also have an epic abortion in a plane?

Implementation details for those interested:

Data munging:

* Filter out all comments below 20 karma (fat lot of use that was), comments longer than 50, deleted comments etc.
* Also had to filter out 'Robert Paulson', there are entire threads full of that guy and the model would say 'Robert Paulson' all the time.
* of the remaining comments paired up comment -&gt; reply pairs from threads to train on, no other features yet.


Model:

* Vanilla character seq2seq LSTM.
* RMSProp
* LEARNING_RATE = 0.01
* SEQ_MAX_LEN = 50
* RNN_HIDDEN_SIZE = 1024
* LAYERS = 3
* CHAR_EMB_SIZE = 128
* VOCAB_SIZE = 95
* Trained overnight, got nowhere near through a singe epoch.
