Can't seem to find anything. Most I've found is some guy's blog who wrote something for sympy a few years ago but I can't seem to get his code to run: https://zulko.wordpress.com/2012/04/15/symbolic-matrix-differentiation-with-sympy/

Ideally it would be able to do at least some of the stuff in the matrix cookbook (https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~hwolkowi/matrixcookbook.pdf) and then be able to apply stuff like the chain rule and product rule.
