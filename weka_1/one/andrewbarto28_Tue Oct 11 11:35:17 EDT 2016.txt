I have several methods and for each one I am selecting hyperparameters in the same validation set. I know that the accuracies obtained in the validation set will be higher than the real ones, but will ordering of the results in the validation set represent the real ordering? In other words, if I want to show which method is better than the other, is it fine to just compare the validation accuracy of the best hyperparameter for each method?
