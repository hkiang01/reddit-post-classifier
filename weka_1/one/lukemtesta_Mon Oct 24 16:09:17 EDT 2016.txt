I need help finding a dataset with handwritten unicode characters. Some exist covering latin numerals and the English alphabet but none include characters for punctuation and mathematical operators. 

ImageNet and VOC doesn't cover these. The MNIST covers digits 0-9, likewise Char74K has numeral and lower/upper case letters for the Latin and Hindu-Arabic systems. 
More suited datasets like HWRT and Detexify are private. I've also considered curating a dataset with Flickr but could not scrape enough images per category. Does anyone have any advice/know a public dataset that meet my criteria? Thanks in advance!
