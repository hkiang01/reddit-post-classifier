Hey ML,

I started coming here around 4 months ago (on and off) and I was wondering who are you?

At first I thought there were only ML enthusiasts here until I got replies from actual faculty. Also talk about people meeting and NIPS and such...

So the question is... Who are you or better yet what is your motive for being here?

I can say I work in research in the private sector, but my work as very little to do with ML. I am mostly here to see trends and also try to understand new algorithms which might be relevant in the near future.
