Now we need your help to evaluate our work! In particular, we need human ears to evaluate, in the first place, how “Bach-like” our outputs are. Therefore, in the second part of  the experiment, we would like to ask you to discriminate between Bach and a computer. The results of the test as well as all technical information about the models will be disclosed in an upcoming paper. The test takes just a few minutes! You can play even if you don’t listen to classical music (we just ask you to tell it to us). Please participate here:   http://flow-machines.com:3005
