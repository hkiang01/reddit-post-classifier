Google will start equipping its sprawling data center infrastructure with AMD's graphics processing units (or GPUs) to accelerate deep learning applications, AMD announced on Tuesday at a supercomputing conference in Salt Lake City, Utah. GPUs, typically used for generating the latest in gaming graphics, have been booming in deep learning, which is a flavor of artificial intelligence where the computer teaches itself how to do certain tasks. GPUs have caught on because of their capabilities in "parallel computing," a technique that involves multiple calculations happening simultaneously. That makes GPUs much faster at running deep learning neural nets than more generalized processors. AMD's rival, Nvidia, has been the primary chip provider here.

Google plans to start rolling out the AMD hardware in 2017 into its cloud products, the Google Compute Engine and the Google Cloud Machine Learning service. This is a big customer announcement for AMD, who has been struggling to bring its data center business back to life. AMD has other data center deals in the works. In October, it announced a GPU deal for Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba's data centers. “Google is building up its GPU-based infrastructure, and they want to ensure they offer AMD's architecture,” said Raja Koduri, senior vice president and chief architect at AMD, in an interview. “Nobody has heard what AMD is doing in deep learning. This is a major first step for us.” AMD's GPU rival, Nvidia, is way out ahead of the company in the data center and deep learning market. The company started out in this market several years ago and its early bets have started paying off. In Nvidia's third quarter earnings, published last week, it reported that the data center revenue grew 193% year-over-year to $240 million. Nvidia is already supplying loads of its chips to large tech players like Google. It's likely Google wants to second source its data center GPUs to give it more power in price negotiations with Nvidia. AMD thinks it has a good chance to compete in the market. "Our dual GPU server products have more floating-point compute operations than Nvidia and more memory bandwidth," said Koduri. "We can run deep neural network algorithms much faster." (The number of floating-point operations a computer can calculate per second is used as a performance metric.) "The appetite for more compute and bandwidth is huge," he said. "Customers are just lining up." To help AMD compete in the deep learning market, the company also announced an updated set of software tools for developing deep learning applications on AMD's GPUs called the Radeon Open Compute Platform. It contains software support for programming on GPU hardware and math libraries. But again, Nvidia is way ahead of AMD here. It's been providing software tools for deep learning to developers for years now. AMD has a lot of catching up to do.
