Dear Friends, 

You can now download the first 12 chapters of the Machine Learning Yearning book draft. These chapters discuss how good machine learning strategy will help you, and give new guidelines for setting up your datasets and evaluation metric in the deep learning era. 

You can download the text here (5.3MB): [REMOVED]*

Thank you for your patience. I ended up making many revisions before feeling this was ready to send to you. Additional chapters will be coming in the next week.

I would love to hear from you. To ask questions, discuss the content, or give feedback, please post on Reddit at:
