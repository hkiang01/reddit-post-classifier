Google opens new AI lab and invests $3.4M in Montreal-based AI research Posted Nov 21, 2016 by Darrell Etherington (@etherington) 0 SHARES Next Story Spectacles finally arrive in NYC with a Central Park Snapbot store Google has invested a total of $4.5 million CAD ($3.4M US) in AI research in Montreal’s Institute for Learning Algorithms, with an academic fund covering three years that will help pay for seven faculty members across various Montreal academic institutions, including the University of Montreal and McGill. The investment is also continued backing for deep learning expert Yoshua Bengio’s work, and is part of Google’s continued bet on Canada’s strong expertise in machine learning and AI research, both of which are becoming increasingly important to its core business. To that end, along with the investment, Google is also opening a brand new deep learning and AI research group in Montreal at its existing office in the city. The new team will be a remote arm of its Google Brain team based in Mountain View, and will be led locally by Hugo Larochelle, a deep learning expert who’s returning home to Montreal from a role with Twitter in Boston specifically for the new position. Google notes that its total investment in academic research in Canada to date now amounts to around $13 million Canadian over the past 10 years, and it hopes that the new investment will help with the ongoing formation of an AI supercluster in Montreal, which is becoming a hotbed for AI startups as well as academic research. Google also has significant presence in Canada via a Waterloo engineering office, and works with AI expert and University of Toronto CS professor Geoffrey Hinton on a lot of its deep learning research. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Newsletter Subscriptions The Daily Crunch Get the top tech stories of the day delivered to your inbox TC Weekly Roundup Get a weekly recap of the biggest tech stories Crunchbase Daily The latest startup funding announcements Enter Address Subscribe SEE ALL NEWSLETTERS » Latest Crunch Report GoPro Cuts 15% of Workforce | Crunch Report Watch More Episodes Artificial Intelligence Popular Posts Featured Stories The Emotion Journal wins the Disrupt London 2016 Hackathon Grand Prize 3 hours ago | Romain Dillet My Bricks Online puts your smartphone in Lego to make playtime fun again 3 hours ago | Jon Russell Disrupt Hackathon app Notim.press/ed algorithmically detects fake news 3 hours ago | Josh Constine Amplify lets you play synchronized songs across every phone in the room 4 hours ago | Matthew Lynley Latest From TechCrunch VeeCee gives kids a shoppable wish list with virtual currency 1 hour ago | Jonathan Shieber Mischief managed: 5 hackathon hacks for Potter fans inspired by the Marauder’s Map 1 hour ago | Ingrid Lunden Three cheers for Valley capitalism 2 hours ago | Jon Evans, Columnist Wandered.space helps you explore the cool spots all around you 3 hours ago | Anthony Ha Comment moderation powered by Up Next Spectacles finally arrive in NYC with a Central Park Snapbot store Posted Nov 21, 2016 CrunchBoard Job Listings ENGINEER - RESEARCH ENGINEER - SPACE & ENERGY SYSTEMS at Southwest Research Institute (San Antonio, TX, United States) RESEARCH ANALYST - SR.
