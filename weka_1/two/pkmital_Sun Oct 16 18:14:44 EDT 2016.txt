Students will be required to submit 5 courseworks completing the given iPython/Jupyter notebooks and 1 open-ended final project. This course requires a total of approximately 50-60hours of work, including both lectures and independent student learning time. Plagiarism:We learn by doing our own work, and by collaborating with other students. Discussing course content and assignments with your peers is an important and helpful way to deepen your learning. However, encouraging others to copy your homework and submit it as their own is a form of cheating. So please don't post your completed assignments or correct answers to quizzes, tests, or other assessments to the discussion forums or in repositories outside of Kadenze.
