Subreddit, who would be game for a beer at NIPS this december ? 

I was thinking a bar either 7ish or 10ish pm. Depending on interest, I have a few contacts in the city who could help talking to a bar owner and reserve some space in advance.

I've put a doodle at http://doodle.com/poll/3qi9i4ncgqnnpv33#table to select one evening ?

Good ideas 'often' go with good IPAs ^^ , bad ideas too...

EDIT: this seems to converge on either Tuesday 12/6 or Wednesday 12/7 starting at 10pm. I'll wait for another 10 days then update this post with final day + venue. Any suggestion welcome.

EDIT 11/29/2016: Wednesday 12/7 10PM is the final choice. I will update here and a comment with the final selected bar or a selection of them.

FINAL EDIT: bar will be Belchica, http://belchica.be/ see location: https://www.google.fr/maps/place/bELchiCA/@41.3860793,2.1632869,15.17z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x12a4a2897653e6d7:0x47f8787834a42437!8m2!3d41.3836144!4d2.1591054 
Several reasons: good neighborhood, easy access, close at 3am, awesome beers, owner is from Belgium, but with a Catalan taste.
Note that I'll advertize again, and on the Whova conference app as well.
