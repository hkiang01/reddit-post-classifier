Statistics > Machine Learning Title: Generative Adversarial Nets from a Density Ratio Estimation Perspective Authors: Masatoshi Uehara, Issei Sato, Masahiro Suzuki, Kotaro Nakayama, Yutaka Matsuo (Submitted on 10 Oct 2016 (v1), last revised 9 Nov 2016 (this version, v2)) Abstract: Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are successful deep generative models. GANs are based on a two-player minimax game. However, the objective function derived in the original motivation is changed to obtain stronger gradients when learning the generator. We propose a novel algorithm that repeats the density ratio estimation and f-divergence minimization. Our algorithm offers a new perspective toward the understanding of GANs and is able to make use of multiple viewpoints obtained in the research of density ratio estimation, e.g. what divergence is stable and relative density ratio is useful.
