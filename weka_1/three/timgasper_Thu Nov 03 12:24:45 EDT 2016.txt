Recently, we made our Bitfusion Deep Learning  AMIs available on the newly announced AWS P2 instances. Naturally, one of the first questions that arises is, how does the performance of the new P2 instances compare to that of the the previous generation G2 instances. In this post we take a quick look at single-GPU performance across a variety of convolutional neural networks. To keep things consistent we start each EC2 instance with the exact same AMI, thus keeping the driver, cuda, cudnn, and framework the same across the instances. To evaluate TensorFlow performance we utilized the Bitfusion TensorFlow AMI along with the convnet-benchmark to measure for forward and backward propagation times for some of the more well known convolutional neural networks including AlexNet, Overfeat, VGG, and GoogleNet. Because of the much larger GPU memory of 12 GiB, the P2 instances can accommodate much larger batch sizes than the G2 instances. For the purpose of the benchmarks below, the batch sizes were selected for each network type such that they could run on the G2 as well as on the P2 instances. The Tables below summarize the results obtained for G2 and P2 instances: Averaging the speedup across all four types of networks, the results show an approximate ~2.42x improvement in performance – not bad for an instance which is only ~1.39 more expensive on an hourly on demand basis. We have several other Deep learning AMIs available in the AWS Marketplace including Caffe, Chainer, Theano, Torch, and Digits.  If you are interested in seeing GPU Performance benchmarks for any of the above drop us a note.
