So I hope this is a valid post to make. Some time ago I remember a post here and a paper where the authors showed that taking a weighted average of word embeddings, based on frequencies, to form sentence embeddings works on many sentence level tasks as good as any more sophisticated NLM (like RNN models). I searched for 1h trough my history and I can't find it, I might have read it when I was a guest to a friend of mine. I would be very grateful if someone remembers this post/paper.
