Computer Science > Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Title: Fully Convolutional Instance-aware Semantic Segmentation Authors: Yi Li, Haozhi Qi, Jifeng Dai, Xiangyang Ji, Yichen Wei (Submitted on 23 Nov 2016) Abstract: We present the first fully convolutional end-to-end solution for instance-aware semantic segmentation task. It inherits all the merits of FCNs for semantic segmentation and instance mask proposal. It performs instance mask prediction and classification jointly. The underlying convolutional representation is fully shared between the two sub-tasks, as well as between all regions of interest. The proposed network is highly integrated and achieves state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and efficiency. It wins the COCO 2016 segmentation competition by a large margin.
