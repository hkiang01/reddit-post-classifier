I need something that I can reproduce paper results and experiment myself with different architectures and tuning, extracting embeddings and that sort of thing.

I'm most familiar with Keras but I'm ok with not using it if isn't suitable for this. I know of a couple of frameworks such as TF, TF-Learn, TF-Slim, Theano so I'd like suggestions on which ones I should use. 

Thank you very much.
