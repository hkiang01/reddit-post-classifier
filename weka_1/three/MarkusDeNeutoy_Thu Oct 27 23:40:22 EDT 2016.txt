Computer Science > Computation and Language Title: Learning to Reason With Adaptive Computation Authors: Mark Neumann, Pontus Stenetorp, Sebastian Riedel (Submitted on 24 Oct 2016 (v1), last revised 10 Nov 2016 (this version, v2)) Abstract: Multi-hop inference is necessary for machine learning systems to successfully solve tasks such as Recognising Textual Entailment and Machine Reading. In this work, we demonstrate the effectiveness of adaptive computation for learning the number of inference steps required for examples of different complexity and that learning the correct number of inference steps is difficult. We introduce the first model involving Adaptive Computation Time which provides a small performance benefit on top of a similar model without an adaptive component as well as enabling considerable insight into the reasoning process of the model.
