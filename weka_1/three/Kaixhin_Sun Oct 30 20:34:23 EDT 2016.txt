Computer Science > Learning Title: Improving Sampling from Generative Autoencoders with Markov Chains Authors: Kai Arulkumaran, Antonia Creswell, Anil Anthony Bharath (Submitted on 28 Oct 2016 (v1), last revised 7 Nov 2016 (this version, v2)) Abstract: We focus on generative autoencoders, such as variational or adversarial autoencoders, which jointly learn a generative model alongside an inference model. Generative autoencoders are those which are trained to softly enforce a prior on the latent distribution learned by the inference model. However, the inference model may not always map inputs to latent samples that are consistent with the prior. We formulate a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling process, equivalent to iteratively encoding and decoding, which allows us to sample from the learned latent distribution. Using this, we can improve the quality of samples drawn from the model, especially when the learned distribution is far from the prior. Using MCMC sampling, we are able to reveal previously unseen differences between generative autoencoders trained either with or without a denoising criterion.
