Computer Science > Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Title: Deep Feature Flow for Video Recognition Authors: Xizhou Zhu, Yuwen Xiong, Jifeng Dai, Lu Yuan, Yichen Wei (Submitted on 23 Nov 2016) Abstract: Deep convolutional neutral networks have achieved great success on image recognition tasks. Yet, it is non-trivial to transfer the state-of-the-art image recognition networks to videos as per-frame evaluation is too slow and unaffordable. We present deep feature flow, a fast and accurate framework for video recognition. It runs the expensive convolutional sub-network only on sparse key frames and propagates their deep feature maps to other frames via a flow field. It achieves significant speedup as flow computation is relatively fast. The end-to-end training of the whole architecture significantly boosts the recognition accuracy. Deep feature flow is flexible and general. It is validated on two recent large scale video datasets. It makes a large step towards practical video recognition.
