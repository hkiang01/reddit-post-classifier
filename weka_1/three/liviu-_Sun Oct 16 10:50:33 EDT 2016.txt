Computer Science > Neural and Evolutionary Computing Title: Temporal Ensembling for Semi-Supervised Learning Authors: Samuli Laine, Timo Aila (Submitted on 7 Oct 2016 (v1), last revised 7 Nov 2016 (this version, v2)) Abstract: In this paper, we present a simple and efficient method for training deep neural networks in a semi-supervised setting where only a small portion of training data is labeled. We introduce self-ensembling, where we form a consensus prediction of the unknown labels using the outputs of the network-in-training on different epochs, and most importantly, under different regularization and input augmentation conditions. This ensemble prediction can be expected to be a better predictor for the unknown labels than the output of the network at the most recent training epoch, and can thus be used as a target for training. Using our method, we set new records for two standard semi-supervised learning benchmarks, reducing the (non-augmented) classification error rate from 18.44% to 7.05% in SVHN with 500 labels and from 18.63% to 16.55% in CIFAR-10 with 4000 labels, and further to 5.12% and 12.16% by enabling the standard augmentations. We additionally demonstrate good tolerance to incorrect labels. Comments: This version was submitted to ICLR 2017. The two methods are now closer to each other and use similar parameters. Also added more experimental results and a test with corrupted labels.
