Hi /r/Machinelearning!


This is my first post on this subreddit. I am interested in what the reddit community thinks of my thesis topic which utilizes machine learning to solve a classification problem. I am investigating the development of a software system for a self-sorting smart bin that can identify and sort plastics, metals, glass, and landfill.


One of the biggest problems to crack is the identification and classification of items input into the bin. I intend to have an identification chamber fitted with a array of instruments and sensors which would provide valuable data streams characterizing the material of the input item:

* Camera -&gt; image processing

* Microphone -&gt; acoustic data

* Spectrographs -&gt; spectroscopic data

* Metal detector -&gt; electromagnetic data


I have yet to select a machine learning algorithm to solve this classification problem but 'adaptive interactive modelling systems' looks very promising. Otherwise I would assume that artificial neural nets would be the way to go.


I am seeking any critical feedback or advice that will be of help to my project!


Many thanks,

TeebS
